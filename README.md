### Immediately

- [ ] build a todo based on the complexity of the tasks.

- [ ] refactor the project as a whole to ASTRO SSG for _performance_
- [ ] add classic Japanese "wrong" or "right" sounds
- [ ] add dark theme
- [ ] make question "auto-send" if chars on input are correct
- [ ] add real words using kana at the end (stage 4)
- [ ] maybe create a settings popup (to store theme and if sounds)

### Futurely

- [ ] rebuild this project on a more modern framework and using better UI elements.
